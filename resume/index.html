                            offerings to physical spaces. My responsibilities include designing and

                            I helped build industry leading mobile UX for experiencing live events.
                            I shared my experience across teams to drive new direction for our 
                            legacy codebase.

                            I was responsible for leading the development team for our Android 
                            product. This included a lot of mentorship, by which I was able to see

                            I was responsible for leading the development team for our Android 
                            product. As an early member of a start-up, I was able to express myself
                            creatively with input on product and design.

                        <p>
                            I was part of a small team making award winning apps. Post-acquisition,
                            our team of two built the Expedia Bookings app. I also had the 
                            opportunity to interact with the community while manning booths at 
                            Mobile World Congress and Google I/O.

                        <p>
                            Since late-2014, I've been using and advocating for Kotlin. I am active 
                            in the community, speaking frequently at conferences and releasing open
                            source developer tools.

                        <h3>Android</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've been using Android since the beta. On opening day of the App 
                            Store, I released “Caller ID by Whitepages”. Over the last ten years 
                            I've continued to release featured and award winning apps downloaded by
                            millions of users.

                        <p>
                            I am a strong believer and practitioner of functional programming. Over 
                            the past few years I have built up the confidence to work effectively 
                            in a functional codebase and mentor others.

                        <p>
                            For the last ten years I have been publishing open source software, 
                            building skills beyond just writing code. My developer libraries have 
                            earned thousands of stars on Github.

                        <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
                        <p>
                            I love mentoring and sharing ideas; public speaking is one of the 
                            primary ways I am able to do this. I have spoken at many large 
                            conferences across the US.
