                        <p>At Revl, I was reponsible for leading the development team for our Android product. This included a lot of mentorship, by which I was able to see my team learn and grow their skills.</p>

                        <p>At Trove, I was reponsible for leading the development team for our Android product. As an early member of a start-up, I was able to epxress myself creatively with input on product and design.</p>

                        <p>I was the second of two pre-aquisition Android developers at Mobiata. I was responsible for the FlightBoard and HomeAway apps. Post-acquisition, our team of two built the Expedia Bookings app. In addition to writing code, I also had the opportunity to interact with the community while manning booths at Mobile World Congress and Google I/O.</p>

                        <h3>Kotlin</h3>
                        <p>Since late-2014, I've been using and advocating for Kotlin. I am active in the community, speaking frequently at conferences and releasing open source developer tools.</p>

                        <h3>Android</h3>
                        <p>I've been using Android since the beta. On opening day of the App Store, I released “Caller ID by Whitepages”. Over the last ten years I've continued to release featured and award winning apps downloaded by millions of users.</p>

                        <h3>Open Source</h3>
                        <p>For the last ten years I have been publishing open source software, building skills beyond just writing code. My developer libraries have earned thousands of stars on Github.</p>

                        <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
                        <p>I love teaching and sharing ideas; public speaking is one of the primary ways I am able to do this. I have spoken at many large conferences across the US.</p>

                        <h3>Technical Writing</h3>
                        <p>A key component of open source is writing technical documentation. Writing prose is a skill I have been able to apply to my work, and readers tend to enjoy my writing voice.</p>
